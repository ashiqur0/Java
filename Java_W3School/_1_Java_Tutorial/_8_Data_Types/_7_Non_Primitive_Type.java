/*
Java Non Primitive Data : Non Primitive Types
Non Primitive Data Types : are called reference type because the refer to objects

Features : (studied from w3school)
1. Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
2. Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
3. Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
4. Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be null.
Example : String, Arrays, Classes etc
